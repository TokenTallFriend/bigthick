# The Big Thick
Max 8 code for my Intro to Audio Tech I final project. The idea was to add different layers of my guitar tone on top of the original signal. That includes harmonizers, chorus, and reverb.

## Harmonizers
You can add a synthesized or pitch shifted signal on top of your original dry signal. The pitch tracking isn't perfect, since I am using an object designed for sounds without percussive elements. If I ever want to make this project more usable I would make the input tracking more guitar friendly, but I haven't had a song need the sound enough for me to incorporate Max into my live set.
